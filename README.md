# CIN-CITY-Distributable
Civic InnovatioN in CommunITY (CIN-CITY): An open source, distributable version of the mobile app originally written by Research IT's Mobile Development Service. The private repository can be found [here](https://github.com/UoMResearchIT/CIN_CITY).

## Getting Started
The app is written for Android at present but it is written using Microsoft's cross-platform Xamarin.Forms framework which means it can easily be extended to compile for iOS with little additional effort since most of the code lives in a .NET Standard project within the solution which is shared between platforms. For more information on Xamarin.Forms see the [online documentation](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/xamarin/xamarin-forms). _Note that from 2022, Xamarin.Forms is evolving into .NET MAUI, Microsoft's next generation cross-platform mobile framework so this app may be migrated to the new iteration if necessary._
