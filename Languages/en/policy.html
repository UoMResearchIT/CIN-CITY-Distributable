        </div>

        <p>This PIS should be read in conjunction with The University of Manchester Privacy Policy for Research Participants.</p>
        <p>You are being invited to take part in a research study concerning people's different perception of urban space. The aim of this research is to find and describe temporal trends of three types of perception in a cyclical time period (days / nights, working days / weekends, seasons). We will study, and subsequently compare, two cities – Manchester (UK) and Olomouc (Czech Republic). Before you decide whether to take part, it is important for you to understand why the research is being conducted and what it will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully before deciding whether to take part, and discuss it with others if you wish. Please ask if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. Thank you for taking the time to read this.</p>
        <div id="who-will-conduct-the-research" class="section level2">
            <h3>Who will conduct the research?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Dr. Jonathan Huck – Department of Geography, School of Environment, Education and Development, The University of Manchester</li>
                <li>Mgr. Lucia Brisudová – Department of Geography, Faculty of Science, Palacký University Olomouc</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="what-is-the-purpose-of-the-research" class="section level2">
            <h3>What is the purpose of the research?</h3>
            <p>In this research we will focus on three types of perception of space. Places considered as pleasant (1. topophilic), unpleasant (2. topophobic) and abandoned or vacant places that could be treated and utilised in a better way (3. topovacant). We will observe time as an essential component of perception of space. We will collect data on perception using a mobile application which enables real-time and in-situ data collection. This novel approach has the potential to provide new perspectives on the perception of place and therefore could represent an important contribution into behavioural geography. The selection of participants is based on a few pragmatic criteria that include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>presence of the participant in the city during whole year,</li>
                <li>the minimum age (18 years),</li>
                <li>ownership of a smartphone with an Android operating system.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Last but not least, an interest in the topic of the research is another very important criterium. The higher the number of research participants, the better the quality of the data.</p>
        </div>
        <div  class="section level2">
            <h3>Will the outcomes of the research be published?</h3>
            <p>The results stemming from this research will be in the form of articles presented in relevant journals (from the field of geography). The findings will also be used in the thesis of the PhD student from Palacký University, Olomouc (Lucia Brisudová).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section level2">
            <h3>Who has reviewed the research project?</h3>
            <p>The project has been reviewed by The University of Manchester Research Ethics Committee.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section level2">
            <h3>What would I be asked to do if I took part?</h3>
            <p>When you take part in the research, you take part in the following activities:</p>
            <p><strong>Map-Me online survey</strong> – you will be asked to fill out an online survey which includes a basic personal questionnaire with 10 questions. The second part of this survey contains a map and several additional questions. Both parts together will take approximately 20 minutes to complete.</p>
            <p><strong>CIN-CITY mobile application</strong> – after filling in the Map-Me survey you will be asked to install the mobile application (CIN-CITY). This app will serve as the main reporting tool and is designed for data collection throughout the remainder of the research project. Your role will be recording your current perception of an urban space during three days (Wednesday, Friday, Saturday). You can make reports any time during the day. When making a new report, the application will save your location and current time and ask a few more questions concerning the type of perception. Because of the complexity of the research, this procedure will be repeated in all four seasons (as seen in the scheme below). Three identical data collection days are selected for each season. The time needed for this part of research will differ based on the number of reports you choose to make during each day.</p>
            <p>All steps will be explained in information material and video tutorials that every participant receives before the start of the research project.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section level2">
            <h3>Will I be compensated for taking part?</h3>
            <p>There are no compensation arrangements for the participants. Since there should be no expenses for participants, financial compensation is not necessary.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="what-happens-if-i-do-not-want-to-take-part-or-if-i-change-my-mind" class="section level2">
            <h3>What happens if I do not want to take part or if I change my mind?</h3>
            <p>It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you ave questions around whether you should decide to take part or not, you should send an email to one of the researchers so they can provide further information. If you do decide to take part, you will be given this information sheet to keep and will be asked to sign a consent form, provide verbal consent or will be asked to tick a box to confirm consent. If you decide to take part you are still free to withdraw at any time without giving a reason and without detriment to yourself. However, it will not be possible to remove any anonymised data from the project as we will not be able to identify your specific data. This does not affect your data protection rights. If you decide not to take part you do not need to do anything further.</p>
